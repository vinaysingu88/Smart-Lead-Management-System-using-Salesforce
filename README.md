# Simple Salesforce Lead Management Project

This is a project I built in a Salesforce Developer Org to demonstrate core admin skills. The goal was to create a simple, functional system to track new product leads.

### What I Built:

1.  **Custom Object:**
    * Created a new custom object named `Product Lead`.

2.  **Custom Fields:**
    * `Lead Name` (Standard Name field)
    * `Status` (Picklist with values: New, Contacted, Qualified, Unqualified)
    * `Source` (Picklist with values: Web, Referral, Event, Partner)

3.  **Custom Tab:**
    * Created a "Product Leads" tab (with a custom icon) and added it to the "Sales" App.

4.  **Report & Data:**
    * Created a custom "Product Leads by Status" report to track all leads, grouped by their current status and source.

### Final Output

Here is a screenshot of the final report running in my org:
